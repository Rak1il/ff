#  Saudi Stock Prediction


## Overview
The stock market is an ever-changing (dynamic) environment whose movements and fluctuations are affected by many factors such as news, previous prices and several other factors. As news and previous prices are considered one of the most important factors influencing the market and we want to measure the extent of the news’s impact on prices, predict the next price based on previous prices using deep learning techniques to help market analysts detect fraud or insider trading.

## Introduction

In an effort to contribute to achieving Saudi Vision 2030, which aims to develop the financial sector and make Tadawul the main market regionally and combat corruption in it.​

We used AI to find out whether Saudi news affects market prices as is the case with foreign news and we create a model that predicts the stock price and then compares it to the real price in order to detect the presence of abnormal events in the stock market to help market analysts detect fraud and insider trading
